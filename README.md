# VBA Stocks Analysis Challenge
##Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide information to Steve, regarding the value of his parents' investments in the stock market.  Steve is concerned that his parents are not getting a return on their investment in the stocks they purchased for DQ, and would like to show his parents the value of their returns.  When performing the initial analysis for Steve, it was noted that DQ performed at a rate of nearly a -60% return [(https://github.com/crtallent/stock-analysis/blob/main/green_stocks.xlsm!)]  This was, of course, very concerning to Steve, who wanted to find out how other stocks fared in relation to DQ.
